 Measuring objects within an image or frame can be an important capability for many applications where computer vision is required instead of making physical measurements.
 This application note will cover a basic step-by-step algorithm for isolating a desired object and measuring size of that object.
 Process:
 Import Image
 Segment Image
	segmenting the image into a binary image to differentiate the background from the desired objects.
 Segmentation
	Removal of noice 
 Measuring Image
	includes Calculation of area , perimeter and diameter of object based on the shape of object.

Through this application we will be able to write a MATLAB script file to import an image, 
segment the image in order to isolate the desired object from its background and then use the 
MATLAB functions that come with the Image Processing Toolbox to determine the objects size. I
